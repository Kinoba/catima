# Contributing to CATIMA

__Welcome!__ We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to CATIMA! If you're unsure about _anything_, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions, and we appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. All project members follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and all contributors should do the same.

If you have any questions just [drop us an email](mailto:christian.kaiser@unil.ch).
